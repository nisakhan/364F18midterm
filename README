Enter a movie you watched recently, your rating of that movie (no percent sign and must be between 0-100), and a funky display name (must be longer than 2 words. Have fun with it!). It will be added to a database of movies that you and friends love! In the movies page, you will get to see what others rated it on The Movie Database API and compare the scores!

It's a handy notepad of your favorite pieces of work and what you think about them!

You CAN save the same movie twice-- but it has to have either a different rating or user!
